# Lluís Vinent Juanico Portfolio

This portfolio is a project carried out for the subject 'Multimedia and user interfaces' of the computer engineering degree at the Universitat de Girona.

## The Final User

The people I expect to visit my portfolio are potential employers or collaborators who want to know more about me. They're looking for details about my background, education, work experience, skills, accomplishments and availability.

My website needs to be direct, easy to navigate, well-organized, making it simple for them to explore both my CV and portfolio. Also, I'll make sure the website is mobile-friendly, as potential employers may access it from various devices.

In order to showcase my skills effectively, I'll include a section where I'll display projects I've worked on, along with detailed descriptions of my contributions and the technologies used. This will provide potential employers and collaborators with a clear understanding of my capabilities and expertise.

## Information Architecture
The site will consist of very defined information modules.
Navigation between information modules will be done through a very simple menu.

#### About
This section will introduce me as a professional. It will include basic information about my personal background and some key aspects about my work and skills.

#### Projects
It will contain the most relevant projects I have worked on.

#### Education
It will show a timeline with the studies I have completed, as well as the date and educational institution.

#### Experience
It will show a timeline with my work experience.

#### Contact
It will include links to my social networks and my email. It will also include the date from which I am available to work on other projects.

## Visual Design

Due to the nature of this project I have decided to adopt a very minimalist and elegant style.

For a long time I wanted to make a project 'serious' enough that I can use only grayscale as a color palette. So this is the perfect occasion to create a black and white project, where contrast is the main element of the design.
Also, I wanted to program a shader, so it was the perfect excuse to program a cool shader that would give contrast and elegance to the background.

### Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Background | ![#000000](https://via.placeholder.com/10/000000?text=+) #000000 |
| Line color | ![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/10/808080?text=+) #808080 |
| Primary color | ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/10/ffffff?text=+) #ffffff |
| Secondary color | ![#808080](https://via.placeholder.com/10/808080?text=+) #808080 |

### Typography

The font I use in most of my projects is 'Monsterrat'. In this case, it is the main font, but I also use 'Maitree' for the subtitles and 'Inter' for the text.
I have used the page https://fontjoy.com/ to find fonts that look good using Montserran as a base.

| Typography         | Font Family                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Title         | Montserrat, sans-serif       |
| Subtitle         | Maitree, serif      |
| Text     | Inter, sans-serif |

### Page Layout

I wanted the user to feel that the information on the screen is really important, so the best way I could think of is to put very little information at a time.

So that it is not visually unbalanced, I have placed the menu in the upper left corner and the content in the lower right corner, and in the middle there is a large space to show a nice background and be able to play with the contrast.

When the window is narrow (such as on mobile devices) the content will be placed directly below the menu.
